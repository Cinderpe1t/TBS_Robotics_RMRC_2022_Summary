The robot has the NVIDIA Jetson Nano on board, two cameras at its front and back, a USB servo motor driver, and four wheel drive servo motors. The robot's forward and backward video streams are displayed at the control station laptop in read time, and the driver should interactively control the robot through a wireless network to reach the destination.
